# Problem 1
Find the images of :

(A) $[-1,1]\times[0,\pi]$, the rectangle, under the map $f(z)=e^z$

(B) $|z|=R$, the circle, under the map $f(z) = \frac{1}{z-R}$

(C) {$z \in \mathbb{C} | |z| < 1, Im(z) > 0$}, the half-disk, under $f(z) = -\frac{1}{2}(z+\frac{1}{z})$



### Solution

(A) First, decompose the map $w = f(z) = e^z$ into two real functions, so $w = u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ where $u,v \in \mathbb{R}$ 

Then $$w = u+iv = e^{z} = e^{x+iy} = e^xe^{iy} = e^x(cosy+isiny) = e^xcosy + ie^xsiny$$ by Eueler's formula. 
So the real part of $w$, $$u(x,y)=e^xcosy$$
The imaginary part of $w$, $$v(x,y)=e^xsiny$$
Since the rectangle looks like this:

(B) Notice $$|z| = R \Rightarrow |x+iy|=R \Rightarrow \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = R$$ And $z = \{re^{i\theta} | r = R\}$ so $z$ is the circle with center $0$ and radius $R$. Then we get that 
$$w = \frac{1}{z-R} = \frac{1}{Re^{i\theta}-R} = (Re^{i\theta}-R)^{-1}$$ 
So $z$ becomes the set $\{z | ??\}$ and this is a circle with radius INSERT and center INSERT. We can also say that this is a circle using the fact that linear fractional maps send circles to circles and lines to lines, from lecture. The map w is linear fractional with $a = , b = , c = , d = , $

# Problem 2

(13.4) Find a conformal mapping of the region "between" the circles: $|z| = 2$ and $|z âˆ’ 1| = 1$ onto the unit disc $|z| < 1$

# Solution
(13.4): 

Step 1: Since the two circles $|z| = 2$ and $|z-1| =1$ are tangent to each other at $z=2$, try transformation $f(z) = \frac{1}{z-2}$. 

$$|z| = 2 \Rightarrow |x+iy| = 2 \Rightarrow x^2+y^2 = 4$$
$$|z-1| = 1 \Rightarrow$$
