# Complex Analysis
Notes, Code, and Reference on Complex Analysis. 

Navigate to the Jupyer Notebook corresponding to the Section you want to study. When a file is written in markdown, a pdf is generated as well. The pdf is the readable version of the notes, check that one out. 

/assets/pdf is safe to ignore - it contains my written draft of lecture notes. I have terrible handwriting.

## Section 1:
1.1. The Field $\mathbb{C}$

1.2 The Complex Plane

1.3 Solving the Cubic Equation
# Section 8:
1. Conformal Mapping Problems (in progress)
2. Cross Ratio and Fixed Points (complete notes)
