# Complex Analysis
Notes, Code, and Reference on Complex Analysis. 

`summary_of_complex_analysis.pdf` contains my outline on the subject. While I learned the content in a class at Penn, I've supplemented the notes with examples from other sources/textbooks, my goal was to make the summary as concise but clear as possible. 

When a file is written in markdown, a pdf is generated as well. The pdf is the readable version of the notes, check that one out. 

/assets/pdf is safe to ignore - it contains my written draft of lecture notes. I have terrible handwriting.
