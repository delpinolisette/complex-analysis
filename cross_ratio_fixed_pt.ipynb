    "# Proposition: Fractional Linear Maps Preserve the Cross Ratio:\n",
    "Fractional Linear maps preserve the cross ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "1. Let S be a fractional linear map. $S \\in Aut(\\overline C)$. WTS that the cross ratio of $z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$  is equal to the cross ratio of $Sz_1,Sz_2,Sz_3,Sz_4$.\n",
    "2. Let T be the fractional linear map sending : $$z_1 \\to \\infty$$ $$z_2 \\to 0$$ $$z_3 \\to 1$$\n",
    "3. Then the composition $T \\circ S^{-1}$ maps: $$S(z_1) \\to \\infty$$ $$S(z_2) \\to 0$$ $$S(z_3) \\to 1$$ $$S(z_4) \\to (Sz_1, Sz_2, Sz_3, Sz_4)$$\n",
    "4. Then we get that: $$(T \\circ S^{-1})(Sz_4) = T(x_4) = (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4)$$\n",
    "5. Thus, $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4)$ is mapped to $(Sz_1, Sz_2, Sz_3, Sz_4)$ under an FL map. This is what we wanted show. \n",

    "# Theorem: Triples Map To Each Other Under Unique F.L Map:\n",
    "This is the crowning jewel of these notes. This is what all the preliminary material was for: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For any two triples of distinct points $z_1, z_2, z_3$ and $w_1, w_2, w_3$, $\\exists! f \\in Aut(\\mathbb{\\overline C})$ s.t. $f(z_k) = w_k$, for $k=1,2,3$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: Existence\n",
    "\n",
    "We have shown that there exists a unique map T sending: $$z_1 \\to \\infty, z_2 \\to 0, z_3 \\to 1$$ and a map S sending: $$w_1 \\to \\infty, w_2 \\to 0,w_3 \\to 1$$ such that $S^{-1} \\circ T(z_k) = w_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2: Uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "For the uniqueness part, we use the cross ratio. Set $w = f(z)$ and then $(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4) = (w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4)$, which implies that $$\\frac{w-w_2}{w-w_1}\\cdot \\frac{w_3 - w_1}{w_3 - w_2} = \\frac{z-z_2}{z-z_1} \\cdot \\frac{z_3 - z_1}{z_3 - z_2}$$\n",

    "Solving for $w$ in terms of $z$, we get the formula for $f(z)$\n",

    "# Application\n",
    "We can use the equation outlined in the existence part of the proof of the above theorem to write down an explicit map sending $(z_1,z_2,z_3)$ to $(w_1,w_2,w_3)$\n",
